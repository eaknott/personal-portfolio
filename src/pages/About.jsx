              <p>Born and raised in the Washington DC area, I'm now based in another capital, Taipei. Before venturing into the world of web development, I explored various roles such as teaching kindergarten ESL, professional dance and choreography for special events, and voice acting and audio editing for language e-learning platforms. </p>

              <p>Throughout my life, I have valued using technology and software to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and create programs that just make life a little easier. So I decided to take that passion and acquire the skills needed to pursue a more technical career. Now I get to build websites and web apps that solve problems!</p>

              <p>Born and raised in the Washington DC area, I'm now based in another capital, Taipei. Before venturing into the world of web development, I explored various roles such as teaching kindergarten ESL, professional dance and choreography for special events, and working in voice acting and audio editing for language e-learning platforms. </p>
              <br />
              <p>Throughout my life, I have valued using technology and software to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and create programs that just make life a little easier. So I decided to take that passion and learn the skills needed to pursue a more technical career.</p>
              <br />
              <p>In my spare time, I like to volunteer and serve my community by prepping meals to feed the homeless and picking up litter by the riverside in my neighborhood or on the beach. I've always been known to enjoy escape rooms, hiking, and reading outside on sunny days.</p>

              <p>Born and raised in the Washington DC area, I'm now based in Taipei. After finishing my Bachelor's degree in Foreign Languages with a Business minor, I moved to Taiwan to be closer to my family and get in touch with my Taiwanese roots. I've enjoyed exploring various roles such as teaching kindergarten ESL, dancing professionally for special events, and working in audio editing for e-learning platforms.</p>

              <p>Born and raised in the Washington DC area, I'm now based in another capital, Taipei. Before venturing into the world of web development, I explored various roles such as teaching kindergarten ESL, professional dance and choreography for special events, and voice acting and audio editing for language e-learning platforms. </p>

              <p>Throughout my life, I have valued using technology and software to automate tasks, improve efficiency, and create programs that just make life a little easier. So I decided to take that passion and acquire the skills needed to pursue a more technical career. Now I get to build websites and web apps that solve problems!</p>

              <p>In my spare time, I like to volunteer and serve my community by prepping meals to feed the homeless and picking up litter by the riverside or on the beach. I've also been known to enjoy escape rooms, hiking, and reading outside on sunny days and inside next my cats.</p>

Be sure to install React on your machine and follow the instructions on [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

If you like this website and want to use something similar for yourself, you can star and fork this repo but please be sure to attribute/credit me somewhere on your site or in your repo's README.md. Thanks!!

## Issues

- [ ] The lines after each section title are not as spaced or aligned as I'd like them to be, still working on tweaking this aspect (from mobile screens to wider screens)

Although I did not fork or copy code here, much of the design for this website was inspired by [Brittany Chiang's portfolio website](https://v4.brittanychiang.com/). She made use of Gatsby.js, and her design is available for use:
[Brittany Chiang's v4 GitHub](https://github.com/bchiang7/v4).
